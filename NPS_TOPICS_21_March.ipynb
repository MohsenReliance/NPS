Was admitted placed on bedrest and some acclaimed drugs meant to arrest contractions met to be administered. One 500ml infusion, one Intramuscular Injection, 20mg Nifedipine & 4mg Sabutamol was given, the spotting and cramps seem to subside at for a while and continued becoming more intense. I complained to the nurse and asked that the doctor see come see me and administer further intervention nothing was done. Active labor kicked in, when the nurses saw I was in severe pain they went to call the doctor who told a little more while to come to the ward by this time I already had a bulging membrane despite the fact I had a cerclage which was put in place by Expert Obstetrician at LASUTH, knowledge of which was known and on record @Oak. I eventually delivered a live and active preterm baby boy about 25weeks gestation age at about 4.30am on Thurs 18/01/2024.\n",

            "Baby was placed in Incubator and plan for referrals to LASUTH for expert care kicked off yet quite sluggish as the process was finally concluded at about 9am, All this while Baby was alive and active in the incubator. We had to make out of pocket payment for Oak Ambulance to transport baby to place of referral.. Do note Oak doesn't have an Ambulance with mobile incubator nor do they have contacts for such. Hence a nurse manually handled baby provided respiratory assistance via manual equipment. Few minutes after leaving the hospital I noticed the nurse performed CPR (2fingers to the chest method) on my baby, then continued with the manual respiratory assistance.. I sensed something maybe wasn't right but didn't panic believing the nurse had everything under control. At arrival at LASUTH Paediatric unit I was informed the baby was BID( Brought in dead, as pupil was already dilated, and there was no respiratory cooperation) by the way the Ambulance left without prior notification. Do note I wasn't given postpartum recovery drugs nor blood tests PCV,FBC etc carried out before been referred, I spoke with someone at the hospital today and the person claimed the baby was the priority as at the moment and I can always come back for review and lodge complaints.\n",

Was admitted placed on bedrest and some acclaimed drugs meant to arrest contractions met to be administered. One 500ml infusion, one Intramuscular Injection, 20mg Nifedipine & 4mg Sabutamol was given, the spotting and cramps seem to subside at for a while and continued becoming more intense. I complained to the nurse and asked that the doctor see come see me and administer further intervention nothing was done. Active labor kicked in, when the nurses saw I was in severe pain they went to call the doctor who told a little more while to come to the ward by this time I already had a bulging membrane despite the fact I had a cerclage which was put in place by Expert Obstetrician at LASUTH, knowledge of which was known and on record @Oak. I eventually delivered a live and active preterm baby boy about 25weeks gestation age at about 4.30am on Thurs 18/01/2024.\n",

            "Baby was placed in Incubator and plan for referrals to LASUTH for expert care kicked off yet quite sluggish as the process was finally concluded at about 9am, All this while Baby was alive and active in the incubator. We had to make out of pocket payment for Oak Ambulance to transport baby to place of referral.. Do note Oak doesn't have an Ambulance with mobile incubator nor do they have contacts for such. Hence a nurse manually handled baby provided respiratory assistance via manual equipment. Few minutes after leaving the hospital I noticed the nurse performed CPR (2fingers to the chest method) on my baby, then continued with the manual respiratory assistance.. I sensed something maybe wasn't right but didn't panic believing the nurse had everything under control. At arrival at LASUTH Paediatric unit I was informed the baby was BID( Brought in dead, as pupil was already dilated, and there was no respiratory cooperation) by the way the Ambulance left without prior notification. Do note I wasn't given postpartum recovery drugs nor blood tests PCV,FBC etc carried out before been referred, I spoke with someone at the hospital today and the person claimed the baby was the priority as at the moment and I can always come back for review and lodge complaints.\n",

They resumed promptly at 9am and I sauntered up the gloomy steps through a dirty hall way into the waiting room. They took near an hour to wrap up all of the consultation and prescription. Safe for a moment of slight hostility rising in the voice of the attending; I found the experience rather seamless. They did have a drug that needed negotiation with my HMO before being issued - this drew some anxiety on my part, but it was quickly resolved.  \n",

But week days, their services are highly perfect; like today the 24th day of October. I would recognize your facility any time, any day. \\nThey should try to reduce time spent on Saturdays or weekends. I suggest that there be a supervisor during the  weekend to keep them on their toes.\\nDr. Azizat Ilo is highly professional in her conduct and supervisory job; but she isn't always around on Saturdays.  \n",

They resumed promptly at 9am and I sauntered up the gloomy steps through a dirty hall way into the waiting room. They took near an hour to wrap up all of the consultation and prescription. Safe for a moment of slight hostility rising in the voice of the attending; I found the experience rather seamless. They did have a drug that needed negotiation with my HMO before being issued - this drew some anxiety on my part, but it was quickly resolved.   \n",

But week days, their services are highly perfect; like today the 24th day of October. I would recognize your facility any time, any day. \\nThey should try to reduce time spent on Saturdays or weekends. I suggest that there be a supervisor during the  weekend to keep them on their toes.\\nDr. Azizat Ilo is highly professional in her conduct and supervisory job; but she isn't always around on Saturdays.   \n",
